Have you been tired of writing similar testing code for your deep learning system?
Have you asked yourself why I am repeating test example one after another?
**Shrub** is here for you, a collection of utilities that aims to
improve your experience of developping deep learning system.

Create tensors, manipulate layouts and data types of them;
use same model description with layout-aware for different systems;
manage data for numerous frameworks, or engines, and validate them;
and son on.


## Usage

Install via `pip install shrub`. *A lot dependency will be installed too, take care of that.*

`shrub.network` is where the `Tensor` and `Model` locates.
Others are basically runners, try and hack them!

No documents so far :(
